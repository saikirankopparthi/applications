## Getting Started

If you need an API key you can get it from [Spawner](https://spawner.ai)

Using a python3 environment, run the following to install all the libraries used in this repository:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Recommend using conda or virtualenv to sandbox your work

### Manual Install 
If you go the manual route instead of requirements we recommend using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). 
```
pip install streamlit pandas numpy urllib requests
```
